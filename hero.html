    <p> <h3> I chose him as my hero because he is not only one of the most talented and famous athletes I know, but he is also a really successful student, and a very charasmatic person. Everyone he meets says he brings light into the room, and pushes everyone else to be the best person they can be. He is a graduate of the Univeristy of Florida and he is planning a to attend graduate school. He has his priorities striaght and he knows what he wants to do in life. He has lots of support groups, fans, sponsorships, and his current occupation, swimming, is what he loves to do everyday. I want to have an occupation that I love to do as well. I aspire to be as successful as him in both academics and athletics. </h3>
